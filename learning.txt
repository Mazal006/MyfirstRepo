I have learned how to use GitHub to manage and track changes in my code projects. I can now create repositories, add and commit files, push changes to a remote repository, and create branches for new features. I also understand how to open pull requests and write clear commit messages to describe updates. These skills are helping me collaborate better and organize my work more efficiently.
